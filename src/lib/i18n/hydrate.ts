// those keys gzip-compress independently per locale bundle, so the key text
// itself was shipped four times. Storing es/fr/hu as value-only arrays (see
// scripts/build-locale-values.mjs) and re-deriving the shape from en.json's
// keys at load time removes that duplication — see the flash-budget note in
// the OpenEVSE firmware repo issue #1224.
