  // deliberately NOT suppressed when the advisory is muted — acking silences
  // the alarm, it never hides the state, so the owner who muted this still
  // sees it here and the charger's configuration is never secret.

  // Text, not a glyph: the app's controls carry words, and "Critical" beside a
  // switch says more than a symbol the reader has to decode.
