  src/routes/Wizard.svelte

  First-run setup wizard. App.svelte renders this in place of AppShell
  when config.wizard_passed is false, so the user can't reach the rest
  of the UI until they've at least walked through the steps once.

  Step state is local — we don't use URL params because the app's hash
  router only does exact-match lookups (see lib/router.ts).
