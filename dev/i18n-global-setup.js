// Vitest globalSetup: generate the position-encoded es/fr/hu value arrays that
// src/lib/i18n/index.ts and the hydrate tests import before any test module is
// collected. This makes every invocation self-sufficient — including a
// single-file `npx vitest run <file>` or an IDE test run on a fresh clone,
// which never go through a package-manager lifecycle hook.
//
// Non-strict on purpose: if a source catalog is out of sync with en.json, we
// still write the arrays (best-effort) and warn, rather than throwing — a
// throw here aborts the whole run before any test is collected, and would take
// down the 130+ unrelated files plus the locale-parity test whose entire job
// is to name the drifted keys. Best-effort lets that diagnostic run; the
// hydrate round-trip test then fails on exactly the affected key.
